layout should be like 1.png file.

Tasks:
1) Implement the page using React+three.js
2) Adaptability should be at your discretion.
3) Make the text and logo appear with a cutoff from the bottom like on this site when scrolling https://ashfall.studio/
As you can see layout, there are many particles.
An additional plus would be:
make the particles dynamic and additionally so that they somehow react to mouse movement.
An additional plus would be to add a mouseover scramble effect to the navigation like here https://kprverse.com/ (you can not take the background from there, only the text animation)
