Project Overview: Build a React + Three.js web page with particle effects, scroll animations, and interactive mouse effects.

Core Requirements:
React + Three.js Setup

Create a React project (Vite recommended for performance)
Integrate Three.js for 3D graphics
Set up canvas rendering for particles
Particle System

Create dynamic particles using Three.js geometry and materials
'particles system can be create like this
Create a React component using react‑three‑fiber that renders an animated band of particles similar to a pink‑to‑purple wave across the top of a landing page.

Requirements:

Use a <Canvas> from @react-three/fiber and a ParticleWave child component.

In ParticleWave, create a dense grid of points using THREE.Points (or <points>), with a custom bufferGeometry:

Positions in a flat XZ grid (centered on X = 0).

An additional attribute with a random float per particle to vary motion slightly.

Use a custom shaderMaterial (vertex + fragment shaders, GLSL):

Vertex shader:

Start from the grid positions.

Animate the Y position over time with a smooth wave function based on sin of X and Z plus a uTime uniform (e.g. a combination of 2 sine waves so the band has multiple hills/valleys).

Pass the X position and wave strength to the fragment shader as varyings.

Set a point size of about 2–3 pixels.

Fragment shader:

Use gl_PointCoord so each particle is a soft circular dot (discard pixels outside a radius).

Color the particles with a horizontal gradient from pink on the left to purple on the right, based on the varying X (map X to 0–1).

Use additive blending and an alpha that fades toward the edge of each dot to create a glowing look.

In the React component:

Define uniforms uTime, uAmplitude, uFrequency, and uSpeed for the shaderMaterial.

Use useFrame to increment uTime every frame.

Set transparent: true, depthWrite: false, and AdditiveBlending on the material to mimic a neon particle wave.

Camera / scene:

Dark background color (almost black).

Position the camera so the particle band appears as a wide, horizontal wave across roughly the upper half of the viewport (similar to a hero banner background).

Export the main component so it can be used as a hero background behind regular HTML UI (buttons and text overlaid with CSS).”

'
Make particles responsive and animated
Scroll Animation (Cutoff Effect)

Implement text/logo that appears with a "cutoff from the bottom" effect as the user scrolls
Reference: Study the effect on ashfall.studio - text likely uses clipping or mask techniques
Use scroll event listeners to trigger animations
Mouse Interaction

Track mouse movement coordinates
Apply mouse position to particle movement/rotation
Consider using raycasting or position-based calculations
Navigation Text Scramble (Optional Plus)

Add hover effect to nav items that scrambles/distorts text
Reference: Similar to kprverse.com text animation
Use canvas text rendering or DOM manipulation with character randomization
Tech Stack:
Frontend: React
3D Graphics: Three.js
Build Tool: Vite (faster than CRA)
Animation: Three.js built-in or GSAP
Styling: CSS/Tailwind or styled-components
Key Implementation Steps:
Set up React + Three.js canvas
Build particle system with proper performance optimization
Implement scroll detection and text clipping masks
Add mouse tracking for particle reactions
Create navigation hover scramble effect (optional)
